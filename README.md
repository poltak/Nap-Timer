Very simple Android app for creating "nap alarms"; alarms offset by a particular amount of minutes.

Intended only for personal use to learn about Android classes such as Intents, Activities, etc.
although happy for others to use and modify as needed (see LICENCE).

Works with Android API 9 (Gingerbread) and higher.
